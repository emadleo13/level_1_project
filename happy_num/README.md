# HAPPY NUMBERS

A happy number is a positive integer that, when its digits are repeatedly squared and summed, eventually reaches the number 1. If this process results in an endless cycle that does not include 1, the number is considered "unhappy".
For example, 19 is a happy number. Here's why:

- 1² + 9² = 82
- 8² + 2² = 68
- 6² + 8² = 100
- 1² + 0² + 0² = 1
