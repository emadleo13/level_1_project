## Description

Monty Hall refers to both the Canadian-American game show host and a famous probability puzzle named after him. The Monty Hall problem is a paradox where a contestant is asked to choose one of three doors, one of which hides a car while the others hide goats. After the contestant picks a door, the host, Monty Hall, opens another door that he knows contains a goat, and offers the contestant the chance to switch their choice. The counterintuitive solution is that the contestant should always switch, as their probability of winning the car doubles from \(1/3\) to \(2/3\)
